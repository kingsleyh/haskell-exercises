# Basic Expressions and Functions

Everything is an expression or declaration. Expressions are values or functions.

#### Functions

A function is a type of expression. 

```
triple :: Int -> Int
triple x = x * 3
```

The first line is the type annotation and the second is the declaration. 

The function is called name and takes a single argument x and returns x multiplied by 3.
