# Lamda Calculus

### Functions

A function takes inputs (input set / domain) and returns outputs (output set / codomain)

```
f(1) = A
```

1 = input

A = output

#### Referential Transparency

Referential transparency means that given the same input the output should be predicatable.

Invalid:

```
f(1) = A
f(1) = B
```

Valid:

```
f(1) = A
f(2) = A
```   

#### Lambda Terms

* expressions
* variables
* abstractions (functions)

an expression can be a variable or abstraction or combination. An abstraction is a function.

#### Lambda structure

An abstraction / function has 

1. head
2. body
3. dot separates params from the body

```
λx.x
```

The head is everything up to and including the dot. The body is everything after the dot.

This is an anonymous function - given a value it returns the value. It's called the identity function.

Takes a single parameter only which binds any variables with the same name in the body.

When applied the function returns the body.

#### Alpha equivalence

determines if a function is the same as another function based on its terms (params and body)

```
λx.x
λd.d
λz.z
```

Are all the same.

#### Beta reduction

1. substitute the the input for all variables in the body
2. elimitate the head

```
(λx.x) 2
       2
```

returns 2

```
(λx.x+1) 2
         2 + 1
         3
```

returns 3

##### Beta reduction with functions

```
(λx.x)(λy.y)
[x :== (λy.y)]
       λy.y
```

The first x lambda takes the y lambda and returns a y lambda. Use the :== to denote that we are substituting (λy.y) for all instances of x. So we are left with the y lambda.

```
((λx.x)(λy.y) z)
[x :== (λy.y)]
       (λy.y) z
       [y :== z]
              z 
```

Here lambda x takes lambda y and returns lambda y. Lamba y then takes the z and returns it.

#### Free Variables

Any variable in the body which is not part of the head. Alpha equivalence does not apply to free variables.

```
λx.xy
```

y = free variable

```
(λ x.xy) z
(λ[x :== z].xy)
         zy
```

Lambda x takes the z and returns it along with y. The x is substitued for the z everywhere in the body.

#### Multiple arguments
